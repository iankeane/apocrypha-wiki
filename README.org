* About
- This is the repo for managing the apocrypha wiki
- This project uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to manage
  [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) which are organized
  into a wiki
- All entries should be review locally before being submitted as a PR; upon
  merging into main the changes will be reflected in the website immediately
- *NOTE:* This wiki is for managing information specific to the apocrypha rust
  server -- please do not put general rust tips here

* Running the wiki locally (always do this when editing)
- Install the required tools (only needs to run the first time you do this)
  - =pip3 install -r requirements.txt=
- From the root directory of the git repo, run =mkdocs serve=
- Visit =localhost:8000= or =127.0.0.1:8000= in a browser to see the wiki while
  you edit files
  - If something was already running on port 8000, you can run =mkdocs serve
    -a localhost:7777= to run on another port (in this case 7777)

* Structuring files and adding to the wiki
** Navbar Items
- If you want your markdown file to show up in the navbar, add it to the =nav= entry in =mkdocs.yml=
- Once added, sub-items are automatically generated any time you put anything under a header (=#=) in your markdown file, so be judicious in what gets its own header!
** Linking to other entries
- Links can be generated using the markdown filename and the link slug for local files
  - e.g. =[link](getting-started.md#useful-keybindings)=
** Adding Images
- Images are stored using the regular markdown syntax
  - e.g. ![image text](getting-started/image.png)
- In the above example, I put the image in a folder called =getting started= which does not exist and would have to be created
- As convention, please create a directory with the same name as your md file to put images in if you require them so the docs folder doesn't get too crufy
- If possible, use a reasonable image file size for what you're trying to disply

* Submitting wiki additions
- To submit a proposed update, create a branch with your proposed changes and submit a PR
- The PR can be reviewed by an admin and merged
  - Admins should use =squash and merge= and delete the branch when PR is merged
  - Deleted branches for merged PRs can *always* be recovered

* TODO
- Steamdeck setup guide
- Common steam troubleshooting
- Pad out description in index.md, find a nice image to use
- Add server rules in index.md
